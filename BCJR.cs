//Jump statements are used to change the flow of control in a program
// â€” like skipping code, repeating, or exiting early.
//Break,Continue,GOTO,Return,throw...

//Break stops the current iteration..

//Continue skips the current one and switch to next...

//Return exit the method and optionally returns a value...i will tell u when i m working on functions..

//GOTO Jumps to a labeled statement...

//Throw Used to throw an exception...

/*What are Exceptions?
Exceptions are errors or unexpected problems that happen while your program is running.

Instead of crashing your program immediately, C# lets you catch and handle these errors gracefully.

This way, your program can respond (like showing a friendly message) instead of just stopping.*/
